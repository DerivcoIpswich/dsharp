# Getting Started

The following solution hosts a simple Todo application which presents a simple and basic application using DSharp with a loader

## Work left

Due to the current version of DSharp being a stripped out version it no longer has a sample application project.
This needs to be added into DSharp so we can bootstrap simple applications and load all scripts without an issues.

- Create new bootstrapping JS which loads modules and their dependencies
- Update template to use this
- Create new project templates which allow you to make new modules, new applications and styles.
